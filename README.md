# 📝 Task 2: PDF Generator using Python

This repository contains **Task 2** of my internship at **CodeTech**, where I developed a Python-based PDF report generator. The main goal was to read data from a file or input, analyze it, and automatically generate a formatted PDF report using the `FPDF` library.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- To automate the generation of PDF reports using Python.
- To format content using text styles, layout elements, and tables.
- To integrate data into the report dynamically from inputs or files.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- `Python 3.x`
- `fpdf`
- `pandas`
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## 📂 File Structure

```bash
📦 Task2_PDF_Generator
 ┣ 📄 Task2_PDF_Generator.ipynb
 ┗ 📄 README.md
````

---

## 📊 What This Project Does

* Reads data (manually or from a CSV/dataframe).
* Processes the data for inclusion in a report.
* Formats the report with:

  * Headings and sections
  * Tables and analytics
  * Styled fonts and layout
* Generates a downloadable `.pdf` report.

---

## 📌 Key Features

* 📄 Custom page formatting using `FPDF`
* 📊 Dynamic content population from data
* ✅ Clean, professional layout
* 🔁 Easy to reuse for other data/report types

## 🧪 How to Run This Notebook

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Task2_PDF_Generator.git
   cd Task2_PDF_Generator
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install fpdf pandas
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Task2_PDF_Generator.ipynb
   ```

## 📌 Sample Output

* ✅ A professional-looking `.pdf` file is generated
* ✅ Content is automatically filled from the input data
* ✅ Layout is clean and customizable

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

From this task, I learned:

* How to automate document creation with Python.
* How to use `FPDF` for structured layout design.
* How to bridge data with reports in real-world use cases.
